## Project Description

---

__Torrust__ is an open source project that aims to provide you with the tools you need to host your own torrent indexes with ease.

With Torrust you will get a private and public tracker option in addition to web application for uploading and downloading torrents, tracked in the Torrust tracker.

The Torrust name is a combination of Torrent and Rust.
We have a focus on speed, safety and concurrency which is why we use the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

The benefit from Torrust is that Anyone is able to host a (private) BitTorrent tracker and online torrent index with ease to share their digital content!

### Project Structure

- [__Backend__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust/tree/main/backend): A REST API written in Rust with the Actix web framework that acts as a backend for the web application.

- [__Frontend__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust/tree/main/frontend): A Vue application that acts as a frontend for the web application.

- [__Torrust Tracker__](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker): A UDP and HTTP based torrent tracker built with Rust.

## Technologies

Almost all our work is in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

"Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on __safety__, __speed__, and __concurrency__."

## Licensing üßæ

The different repositories may have one or more licenses. These licenses can be found in a markdown file called "LICENSE.md"  in the main folders. In addition to this file, you may also find a folder called "Licensing". This folder is common when there is more than one applicable license. This can be the case when there is for example code and media in the same repository.

The current license are based on [Nautilus Cyberneering](https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/) repository licenses and are applicable to all Torrust projects.

Essentially they are [AGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) for code with some additional licenses dependent on the code's contribution "age".

## Team üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

We are currently a growing small team of contributors developing Torrust. Some of us are contributing for free and others are employed by our main sponsor [Nautilus Cyberneering](https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/).

We are always looking for help and believe that everyone can add value.

---

## Contributing

Torrust is an Open Source project so anyone interested in contributing can do so.

We are looking for proactive, passionate and active contributors and if you are one we will notice you. It is very easy in an Open Source project.

Your contributions can take many forms, working code, new ideas for features, constructive comments in discussions, revisions, improvement suggestions, etc.

Also if you make qualitative contributions that help the team move the project forward these will speak for themselves and our sponsor [Nautilus Cyberneering](https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/) will notice you.

---

## Sponsoring

This project came to be since our current main sponsor [Nautilus Cyberneering](https://nautilus-cyberneering.de/), needed a solution that makes it easy for anyone with a computer and internet connection to share their files with the rest of the world.

You can become a sponsor too so we can grow Torrust together. If you are interested please contact us or follow our [sponsoring link]().
